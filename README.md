# AR Book Cover Project

## Overview

This project is a part of CS 8395 for Spring 2024, focusing on designing an interactive augmented reality (AR) cover for a book. This project includes both front and back covers with engaging AR elements to enhance the reading experience.

## Objective

To create an AR book cover that leverages AR technology to make book covers interactive and visually appealing, emphasizing creativity, design, and the effective use of AR.

## Setup

1. **Download the Code:** After downloading the code folder to your computer, use Unity to import this as a project.
2. **Import and Play:** Once imported, open the project and click on the play button at the top.
3. **Interact with Markers:** Use the marker images found in the repo to interact with the code. For the front cover, you'll see the title, author, and a 3D model displayed. For the back cover, the title, pages, author, and a toggle button (in the shape of a cube) will be shown. Clicking the button toggles between showing all text and just the book's summary.

## Limitations
